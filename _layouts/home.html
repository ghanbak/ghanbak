              <p>
                When I started at Robin, our mobile app did one thing well — automatically book a room when you walk in. The problem was not many people used the app because it did things behind the scenes.

                While at Robin, we asked how we might clear up empty schedules so people can book empty spaces. We made a room display to help schedule spaces and claim a room.

                Boston Art Song’s mission was to bring art song to Boston by promoting collaboration between pianist and singer through the celebration of language and culture and building of community. They needed a platform and brand to do so.
